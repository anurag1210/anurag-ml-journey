# ðŸš€ Anurag's Machine Learning Journey

Welcome! I'm Anurag Gupta â€” a software engineer with 17 years of experience, now diving deep into the world of Machine Learning and AI.

This repository is a public journal of my transition into ML Engineering. I'm using this space to:
- Track my progress
- Reflect on learnings
- Build small and meaningful ML projects
- Document my challenges and wins along the way

---

## ðŸ“˜ Structure

- `notes/`: My week-by-week learning notes and reflections
- `projects/`: Hands-on ML projects and experiments

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

To become a confident, production-ready Machine Learning Engineer by building strong foundations, solving real problems, and deploying meaningful solutions.

---

## ðŸ§  Current Focus

Currently following [Google's Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course), documenting insights and running experiments.
