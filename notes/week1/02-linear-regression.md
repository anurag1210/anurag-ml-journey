# 📈 Linear Regression – Notes

## ✅ 3 Things I Learned
1. The model learns weights and bias using gradient descent to minimize loss.
2. MAE and MSE are both loss functions but behave differently with outliers.
3. Batch size and epochs control how the model trains and when it updates weights.

## 🤔 One Thing That Surprised or Confused Me
- How batch size alone defines whether you're doing stochastic, mini-batch, or full-batch gradient descent.

## ❓ One Question I'd Ask an Expert
- How do you choose the best batch size for a new problem in practice?
