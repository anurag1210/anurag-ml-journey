# 📌 Problem Framing – Notes

## ✅ 3 Things I Learned
1. Problem definition is the most important part of any ML workflow. Before jumping to build models, pause and ask: **Can this be solved with a simple rule-based solution instead?**
2. Asking the right questions upfront — i.e. **how we frame the problem** — determines the success of the ML solution.
3. A successful ML approach needs **properly labeled data**, a clear objective, and solid framing.
4. Sometimes, **simple heuristics** can outperform ML models — especially when data is limited.

## 🤔 One Thing That Surprised or Confused Me
- The concept of **distillation** — how a smaller model learns from a larger one using synthetic labels.

## ❓ One Question I'd Ask an Expert
- How do you frame a problem when the data is **noisy or unstructured** (like free text or messy logs)?
